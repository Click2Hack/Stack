what i wanted is when customers  click on dine in , packaged or container option it will just sort the items that are tick marked as by customer and customers cannot tick mark two things at a time like dine in and packagin both tick mark and customer chose pepsi now we are confused whether it is packaged or dine in so do like choose only one option and second fault that is happening is after clicking on itmes it just create qr which it should not it should just add item in cart and sort the cart such way that it create three sorts differently 

1 which shows order for dine in 
2 shows orders given for packaged 
3 is for container and only those food items under these section show in cart

Problems "i am facing are when customers see momos they see an arrow box in which they can select by default value : Full plate and customer can modify it to half plate {i was not able to implement this logic 


waiter bill water option integration and unlock only after waiter successful qr scanning 

second problem " when ever i click on any item option i wanted like " no. of time button press will multiply with type of quantity choden by customer in cart with 3 different sorted categories so that customers can easily preview the cart  }"

the thing is i want like send bill to customer's whatsapp number after successful purchase if exist...

and do like when customer scan qr from our table it will tell like from which table order has arrived
